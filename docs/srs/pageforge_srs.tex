\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes the complete functional and non-functional requirements for \textbf{PageForge}, a self-hosted static site deployment platform, version 1.0. PageForge enables developers to build, deploy, and serve static websites from Git repositories or ZIP archives with automated build pipelines, custom domain support, and GitHub integration. This document covers the entire system including the web dashboard, REST API, build worker, and infrastructure components.

\subsection{Document Conventions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bold text} is used for emphasis and key terms.
    \item \texttt{Monospace text} is used for code, file paths, API endpoints, and technical identifiers.
    \item Requirements are identified with unique tags: \texttt{FR-XX} for functional requirements, \texttt{NFR-XX} for non-functional requirements.
    \item Use cases are identified as \texttt{UC-XX}.
    \item Design artifacts are identified as \texttt{D-CL-XX} (class diagrams), \texttt{D-SQ-XX} (sequence diagrams), \texttt{D-DB-XX} (database), \texttt{D-SEC-XX} (security).
    \item Priority levels: \textbf{High} (essential for core functionality), \textbf{Medium} (important but not blocking), \textbf{Low} (nice-to-have).
    \item Higher-level requirement priorities are inherited by their child requirements unless explicitly overridden.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is intended for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Developers:} Sections 3--5 for system features, design, and architecture. Start with Section 4.1 (System Architecture) for an overview.

% SECTION 2: OVERALL DESCRIPTION
%===============================================================
\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
PageForge is a new, self-contained product that fills the gap between fully managed deployment platforms (Vercel, Netlify) and manual server configuration. It is designed to run entirely on a user's own infrastructure --- a single Linux server with Docker --- eliminating dependency on third-party hosting services.

The system consists of four major subsystems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Web Application (Next.js 14):} Dashboard UI and REST API server.
    \item \textbf{Build Worker:} Background job processor that executes builds in Docker containers.
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure Services:} MongoDB, Redis, MinIO, and Caddy running as Docker containers.
    \item \textbf{External Integrations:} GitHub OAuth and GitHub API for repository access.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagrams/architecture.pdf}
    \caption{PageForge System Architecture Overview}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Product Functions}
The major functions of PageForge are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Authentication:} Registration with email OTP verification, login (email/password), forgot password via OTP, session management, logout.
    \item \textbf{GitHub OAuth Integration:} Connect/disconnect GitHub account, import private repositories.
    \item \textbf{Project Management:} Create, read, update, delete projects with Git or ZIP sources.
    \item \textbf{Deployment Pipeline:} Trigger builds, execute in Docker containers, stream logs, store artifacts.
    \item \textbf{Environment Variables:} Configure build-time environment variables per project.
    \item \textbf{Custom Domains:} Add custom domains, verify via DNS CNAME, configure routing.
    \item \textbf{Static Site Serving:} Serve deployed sites via Caddy with automatic subdomain routing.
    \item \textbf{Build Log Viewer:} Real-time streaming of build output with stdout/stderr separation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Classes and Characteristics}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Developer (Primary User):} Technical users who deploy static websites. They interact with all features: project creation, deployment, domain management, and GitHub integration. Expected to understand Git, build tools (npm/yarn), and DNS configuration.
    \item \textbf{Administrator:} The person who installs and maintains the PageForge server. Responsible for Docker, DNS, and infrastructure configuration. May also be a developer user.
    \item \textbf{End Visitor:} Visitors who access the deployed static sites. They interact only with the served content through Caddy, not with the PageForge dashboard.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Operating Environment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Server OS:} Linux (tested on Arch Linux; compatible with any Linux distribution with Docker).
    \item \textbf{Runtime:} Node.js 20+ (LTS), Docker Engine 24+.
    \item \textbf{Database:} MongoDB 7.0+.
    \item \textbf{Cache/Queue:} Redis 7.0+.
    \item \textbf{Object Storage:} MinIO (S3-compatible).
    \item \textbf{Reverse Proxy:} Caddy 2.x with JSON admin API.
    \item \textbf{Package Manager:} pnpm 8+ with workspace support.
    \item \textbf{Browser:} Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 90+, Safari 15+, Edge 90+).
    \item \textbf{Optional:} Cloudflare Tunnel for public access without port forwarding.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Monorepo Structure:} pnpm workspace with three packages (\texttt{apps/web}, \texttt{apps/worker}, \texttt{packages/shared}).
    \item \textbf{TypeScript Only:} All code must be written in TypeScript with strict type checking.
    \item \textbf{Edge Runtime Compatibility:} Middleware must not import Node.js-only modules (Mongoose, bcrypt) due to Next.js Edge Runtime restrictions.
    \item \textbf{Docker Dependency:} Build execution requires Docker Engine access via socket (\texttt{/var/run/docker.sock}).
    \item \textbf{Static Sites Only:} Only static site output (HTML/CSS/JS) is supported; no server-side rendering or serverless functions in deployed sites.
    \item \textbf{GitHub OAuth Scope:} The \texttt{repo} scope grants read and write access; GitHub does not offer a read-only scope for private repositories via OAuth Apps.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Documentation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{README.md} --- Installation and quick start guide.
    \item \texttt{.env.example} --- Environment variable reference with descriptions.
    \item In-app contextual help text on forms and configuration screens.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Docker Engine is installed and accessible via the Docker socket.
    \item MongoDB, Redis, and MinIO are running (provided via \texttt{docker-compose.yml}).
    \item The server has internet access for cloning Git repositories and pulling Docker images.
    \item DNS for the base domain (\texttt{*.itspraveen.dpdns.org}) is configured with wildcard resolution pointing to the server.
    \item For GitHub OAuth: a GitHub OAuth App is created with correct client ID, secret, and callback URL.
    \item The \texttt{node:20-alpine} Docker image is available (pulled automatically on first build).
    \item For custom domains: users can configure CNAME records on their DNS provider.
\end{itemize}

    \item After build completes, historical logs are available from MongoDB.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{description}
    \item[FR-82] The system shall provide a WebSocket endpoint at \texttt{/ws/logs/\{deploymentId\}} for live log streaming.
    \item[FR-83] The WebSocket server shall subscribe to Redis Pub/Sub channel \texttt{build-logs:\{deploymentId\}}.
    \item[FR-84] The system shall forward log messages (type, stream, line, timestamp) to connected WebSocket clients.
    \item[FR-85] The system shall also poll the deployment API every 2 seconds as a fallback for log updates.
    \item[FR-86] The system shall display logs with visual distinction between stdout, stderr, and system messages.
    \item[FR-87] The system shall auto-scroll to the latest log entry.
    \item[FR-88] The system shall display deployment status (queued, building, uploading, ready, failed) with colored badges.
\end{description}

\subsection{Forgot Password (OTP-Based Password Reset)}
\subsubsection{Description and Priority}
Allows users to reset their password by verifying their identity via a one-time password sent to their registered email address. \textbf{Priority: High.}

\subsubsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User clicks ``Forgot Password'' on the login page.
    \item User enters their registered email address.
    \item System sends a 6-digit OTP to the email.
    \item User enters the OTP on the verification screen.
    \item System verifies the OTP and presents the password reset form.
    \item User enters and confirms a new password.
    \item System hashes the new password and updates the user record.
    \item System redirects to the login page with a success message.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{description}
    \item[FR-89] The system shall provide a ``Forgot Password'' link on the login page navigating to \texttt{/forgot-password}.
    \item[FR-90] The system shall accept an email address and send a 6-digit OTP to it if the email is registered.
    \item[FR-91] The system shall not reveal whether an email is registered or not (to prevent user enumeration).
    \item[FR-92] The system shall generate a cryptographically random 6-digit OTP with a 5-minute expiry.
    \item[FR-93] The system shall invalidate the OTP after successful verification (single-use).
    \item[FR-94] The system shall present a new password form only after successful OTP verification.
    \item[FR-95] The system shall validate that the new password meets minimum requirements.
    \item[FR-96] The system shall hash the new password using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds and update the user record.
    \item[FR-97] The system shall invalidate all existing sessions for the user after a password reset.
    \item[FR-98] The system shall redirect to the login page after successful password reset.

\section{Software Design}

\subsection{System Architecture}
PageForge follows a \textbf{modular monorepo architecture} with clear separation between the web application, build worker, and shared types. The system uses an \textbf{event-driven build pipeline} with BullMQ for job queuing and Redis Pub/Sub for real-time log streaming.

\subsubsection{Architecture Overview}
The system is divided into the following layers:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Layer:} Next.js 14 App Router with React components, TailwindCSS styling, and client-side hooks (\texttt{useFetch}, \texttt{useMutation}).
    \item \textbf{API Layer:} RESTful API with 14 route handlers, JWT authentication middleware, and ownership-scoped data access.
    \item \textbf{Business Logic Layer:} Auth config, GitHub OAuth flow, project/deployment management, build queue management.
    \item \textbf{Worker Layer:} BullMQ worker process, Docker executor, artifact manager, build logger.
    \item \textbf{Data Layer:} MongoDB (Mongoose ODM), Redis (queue + pub/sub), MinIO (S3 artifact storage).
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure Layer:} Caddy (reverse proxy + static serving), Docker Engine (build isolation), Cloudflare Tunnel (optional public access).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Detailed Design}

\subsubsection{Class Diagrams}
The class diagram shows all major classes across the six modules: Authentication, Project Management, Deployment, Build Worker, Infrastructure, and GitHub Integration.

\begin{landscape}
\begin{figure}[p]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,height=0.85\textheight,keepaspectratio]{diagrams/class_diagram.pdf}
    \caption{Complete Class Diagram (D-CL-01)}
    \label{fig:class}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

\textbf{Key Design Decisions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User} class owns Projects (1-to-many), and Projects own Deployments (1-to-many).
    \item \textbf{EnvironmentVariable}, \textbf{DomainEntry}, \textbf{SourceSnapshot}, \textbf{BuildConfig}, and \textbf{LogEntry} are embedded documents (not separate collections) for performance and atomicity.
    \item \textbf{Sensitive fields} (\texttt{passwordHash}, \texttt{githubAccessToken}, \texttt{gitToken}) use Mongoose \texttt{select: false} and are stripped in \texttt{toJSON}/\texttt{toObject} transforms.
    \item \textbf{BuildWorker} delegates to \textbf{Executor} (Docker), \textbf{ArtifactManager} (MinIO), and \textbf{BuildLogger} (Redis) following the single-responsibility principle.
    \item \textbf{OTPService} manages OTP generation, verification, and email delivery for registration email verification and password reset.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Design}

\subsubsection{Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms}

\paragraph{Authentication Mechanisms (D-SEC-01)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Password-Based Authentication:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds.
        \item Plaintext passwords are never stored or logged.
        \item Authentication is handled by NextAuth.js v5 Credentials provider.
        \item JWT tokens are issued with 30-day maximum age.
        \item Tokens contain user ID, name, and email (no sensitive data).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{OTP-Based Verification:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 6-digit cryptographically random OTP generated per request.
        \item OTPs expire after 5 minutes.
        \item Single-use: invalidated immediately after successful verification.
        \item Delivered via email to the registered address.
        \item Used for two purposes: (1) email verification during registration, (2) identity verification during password reset.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{JWT Session Management:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Strategy: JWT (stateless, no server-side session store).
        \item Token stored in HTTP-only secure cookie.
        \item Maximum age: 30 days.
        \item Token payload: \texttt{\{id, name, email\}}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Authorization Mechanisms (D-SEC-02)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Route Protection via Middleware:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All routes except \texttt{/login}, \texttt{/register}, and \texttt{/api/auth/*} require authentication.
        \item Middleware runs in Edge Runtime for performance.
        \item Unauthenticated requests are redirected to \texttt{/login}.
        \item Authenticated users are redirected away from auth pages.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{API-Level Ownership Checks:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All 8 protected API route files call \texttt{requireAuth()} which extracts \texttt{userId} from the JWT.
        \item All database queries include \texttt{userId} filter to enforce ownership scoping.
        \item Users can only access their own projects, deployments, and settings.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{GitHub OAuth Security:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item OAuth state parameter contains \texttt{userId} to prevent CSRF.
        \item Callback verifies \texttt{state} matches the authenticated user's ID.
        \item Redirect URI uses \texttt{AUTH\_URL} (not request origin) to prevent open redirect.
        \item \texttt{trustHost: true} in NextAuth config for reverse proxy compatibility.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Security Protocols}

\paragraph{SP-01: Secret Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Password hashes:} Stored with Mongoose \texttt{select: false}; stripped in \texttt{toJSON}/\texttt{toObject} transforms.
    \item \textbf{GitHub access tokens:} Stored with \texttt{select: false}; never exposed in API responses; only a \texttt{hasGithubToken} boolean is returned.
    \item \textbf{Project PATs:} Stored with \texttt{select: false}; only \texttt{hasGitToken} boolean is exposed.
    \item \textbf{Auth secret:} \texttt{AUTH\_SECRET} environment variable for JWT signing; never exposed.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{SP-02: Build Container Isolation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Builds execute in ephemeral Docker containers destroyed after each build.
    \item Containers have \texttt{no-new-privileges} security option.
    \item Resource limits: configurable memory (default 512MB) and CPU (default 1 core).
    \item Optional gVisor (\texttt{runsc}) runtime for additional kernel-level sandboxing.
    \item Git credentials passed via environment variable (not command-line arguments) to avoid \texttt{/proc} exposure.
    \item Git credential helper configured inside the container to use the token without embedding in URLs.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{SP-03: Log Sanitization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{sanitize()} function replaces all known secrets in build log output with \texttt{[REDACTED]}.
    \item Secrets sanitized include: \texttt{GIT\_AUTH\_TOKEN}, project PAT, user OAuth token, and all environment variable values.
    \item Sanitization is applied before both Redis publishing and MongoDB persistence.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{SP-04: Reverse Proxy Security}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Caddy handles TLS termination and HTTPS enforcement.
    \item \texttt{trustHost: true} in NextAuth config trusts \texttt{X-Forwarded-*} headers from the proxy.
    \item \texttt{AUTH\_URL} is used as the canonical base URL for all redirect construction (prevents localhost leakage behind proxies).
    \item Cloudflare Tunnel (optional) provides DDoS protection and hides origin server IP.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{SP-05: Data Access Control}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All API routes extract \texttt{userId} from the JWT and filter database queries accordingly.
    \item No cross-user data access is possible through the API.
    \item Deployment artifacts are stored in MinIO with deployment-specific paths.
    \item Caddy routes are configured per-project to serve only the correct artifacts.
\end{itemize}

% SECTION 7: OTHER REQUIREMENTS
%===============================================================
\section{Other Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database:} MongoDB 7.0+ with Mongoose ODM. Connection pooling with cached connection pattern.
    \item \textbf{Internationalization:} Not in scope for v1.0. English only.
    \item \textbf{Legal:} Self-hosted; no data leaves the user's infrastructure (except GitHub API calls). Users are responsible for compliance with their own policies.
    \item \textbf{Reuse:} The \texttt{packages/shared} module is designed for reuse across web app and worker processes.
    \item \textbf{Deployment:} Infrastructure services are containerized via \texttt{docker-compose.yml}. Application processes (web, worker) run natively on the host.
\end{itemize}
